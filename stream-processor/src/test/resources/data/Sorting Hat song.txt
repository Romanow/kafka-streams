Welcome, welcome, one and all.
The show is about to start.
I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat,
and it's time to play my part,
You may call me worn and ragged,
if that's all you truly see.
But listen close and I will tell
where you are supposed to be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,
where the bravest often dwell.
Perhaps it's loyal Hufflepuff,
where your heart will truly swell.
Or could it be wise Ravenclaw,
whose language you speak best.
Yet again, perhaps it's Slytherin,
that will help you top the rest.

Go ahead and try me on.
There is nothing left to fear.
I will find right where you belong
by looking between your ears.
